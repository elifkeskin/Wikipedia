# Wikipedia Text Preprocessing & Visualization

## 📝 Business Problem

This project focuses on the preprocessing and visualization of a dataset containing Wikipedia texts. The goal is to clean, analyze, and visualize textual data to extract meaningful insights and patterns.

## 📂 Dataset Description

The dataset consists of Wikipedia sentences, each identified by a unique ID.
